## Project Status

**We have designed and released [achgateway for orchestrating ACH uploads](https://github.com/moov-io/achgateway) in real production scenarios. Please read [over our guide to achgateway](https://moov.io/blog/education/ach-gateway-guide/) and give us feedback on the design or your experience! We have also realized that KYC/KYB, data modeling, workflows, and risk analysis are difficult to open-source. We are interested in hearing how you have solved these problems internally and want to develop something in the open. Thank you to everyone who has contributed and helped us grow.**

Moov Paygate is a RESTful HTTP API enabling Automated Clearing House ([ACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House)) transactions and returns to be processed with an Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI) without a deep understanding of a full NACHA file specification.

If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability please responsibly report the issue as via email to security@moov.io. Please do not post it to a public issue tracker.

This project is sponsored by Moov Financial, Inc which offers commercial support, hosting, and additional features. Refer to our [Moov's payout documentation](https://moov.io/payouts/) for more information.

## Getting Started

We publish a [public Docker image `moov/paygate`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/paygate/) from Docker Hub or use this repository. No configuration is required to serve on `:8083` and metrics at `:9093/metrics` in Prometheus format. We also have docker images for [OpenShift](https://quay.io/repository/moov/paygate?tab=tags).

Start PayGate and its dependencies:
```
docker-compose up
```

Create an example Transfer
```
go run examples/getting-started/main.go
```
```

## Micro-Deposits

Micro Deposits are used to validate a customer can access an account at another Financial Institution. Typically they are two deposits under $0.50 and a balancing withdraw. The customer supplies both deposited amounts as verification.

Start PayGate and its dependencies:
```
docker-compose up
```

Setup the micro-deposit account to originate from.
```
go run examples/micro-deposits-setup/main.go
```
```

      accountID: "460026b50830443a77253a0e6c7ca1bebae8a731"
===========

Restart PayGate with 'docker-compose up' and run go run /examples/micro-deposits/main.go
```

After updating PayGate's config and restarting (`docker-compose restart`)

```
go run examples/micro-deposits/main.go
```
```

## Supported and Tested Platforms

## Contributing

Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/moov-io/ach/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started! Checkout our [issues for first time contributors](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate/contribute) for something to help out with.

Paygate includes several "long" tests which spawn Docker containers, make requests over the internet, and perform more complicated tests. To skip these long tests add the `-short` flag to `go test`.

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go 1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

### Test Coverage

Improving test coverage is a good candidate for new contributors while also allowing the project to move more quickly by reducing regressions issues that might not be caught before a release is pushed out to our users. One great way to improve coverage is by adding edge cases and different inputs to functions (or [contributing and running fuzzers](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz)).

Tests can run processes (like sqlite databases), but should only do so locally.

Each PR should increase the overall coverage, if possible. You can run `make cover-test` to save a coverage profile and `make cover-web` to open the HTML view in your default browser.
